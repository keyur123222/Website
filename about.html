            <p class="profile-position">Electrical Engineering Student</p>
            <p class="profile-body">My name is Keyur Rana and as a junior at Rutgers University, I am currently working towards earning my degree in
            Electrical Engineering. Ever since I was young, I knew that this field was my true calling. Growing up, I had the
            opportunity to see firsthand how the milling process worked through my father's job as a mill worker. While the process
            itself did not particularly interest me, what stood out to me was the technology and mechanics behind it, specifically,
            the motors that facilitated the milling process. This fascination with technology and its application in the industrial
            world ultimately sparked my interest in electrical engineering.
            
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="profile-body">As I continue to pursue my degree, my passion for electronics and technology development only continues to grow
            stronger. I am driven to make a significant impact in the field of electrical engineering, with the ultimate goal of
            driving exponential growth and innovation in the electronics industry. In my lifetime, I aspire to be a part of shaping
            the future of technology, such as through the development of commercial space travel and advanced satellites that
            improve global communication and even interplanetary communication. I believe that my passion for technology, my
            understanding of the industrial world, and my dedication to my studies will help me achieve this goal.</p>

            <p class="profile-body">Rutgers Formula Racing is a team of Rutgers Student who are dedicated to designing, manufacturing, and racing a Formula SAE race car against other schools. This year around, our car is transitioning from combustion to electric. Which has many benefits and challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="profile-body">The RFR has 8 sub-teams that work on different systems of the car. I am currently on the Electronics/Electric Powertrain. My responsibilites include: researching ways to monitor and
            identify faulty voltages of individual battery cells from a large Li-ion battery pack, designing vehicle's low-voltage
            and high-voltage systems from 12V to 400V etc.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="profile-body">Although I know nothing about cars, I get to learn of all the engineering that goes behind every part of a car and I think that is glamorous and very exciting. In addition, we work with various tools such as Altium Designer, Fusion 360, TinkerCAD, LTspice etc.</p>
