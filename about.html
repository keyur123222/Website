            <p class="profile-position">Electrical Engineering Student</p>
            <p class="profile-body">Hello! I’m Keyur Rana, a passionate Electrical Engineering enthusiast on a journey of continuous learning and exploration. I recently earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in May 2024 and am currently on the path to completing my Master's degree in the same field, with an expected graduation in May 2025.
            
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="profile-body">My fascination with electrical engineering traces back to my childhood experiences. Growing up, I had the privilege of witnessing the intricacies of industrial processes firsthand, thanks to my father's profession as a mill worker. While the milling process itself didn't captivate me, I found myself drawn to the underlying technology driving it forward. It was the motors—the unsung heroes facilitating the milling process—that caught my attention and ignited my curiosity.</p>
            <br>

            
            <p class="profile-body">This early exposure ignited a passion within me for understanding the intricate workings of technology, particularly in the realm of electrical engineering. I am deeply intrigued by the convergence of hardware and its real-world applications, with a keen interest in areas such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Radio Frequency (RF) technology.</p>
            

            <br>
            <p class="profile-body">As I continue my academic journey, I am committed to delving deeper into these areas, seeking to expand my knowledge and skills to contribute meaningfully to the field. Beyond academia, I am eager to apply my learnings to address real-world challenges and make a positive impact.</p>
