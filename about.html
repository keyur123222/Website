            <p class="profile-body">I am currently a sophomore at Rutgers University working on earning my degree in Electrical Engineering. I knew electrical engineering was what I wanted to do from a young age. My father used to be a mill worker, and occasionally I would be able to go experience how the milling process worked. It did not appeal to me; however, seeing how the motors would facilitate the milling process stood out to me. Seeing the technology present fascinated me and exposed my niche in the industrial world.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="profile-body">My passion for electronics and the development of technology continues to shape me today. I hope to one day further develop the electronics industry exponentially. In my lifetime, I hope to at least pave the way for things like commercial space travel and more advanced satellites to improve global communication and even interplanetary communication.</p>

            <p class="profile-body">Rutgers Formula Racing is a team of Rutgers Student who are dedicated to designing, manufacturing, and racing a Formula SAE race car against other schools. This year around, our car is transitioning from combustion to electric. Which has many benefits and challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="profile-body">The RFR has 8 sub-teams that work on different systems of the car. I am currently on the Electronics/Electric Powertrain. My responsibilites include: researching ways to monitor and
            identify faulty voltages of individual battery cells from a large Li-ion battery pack, designing vehicle's low-voltage
            and high-voltage systems from 12V to 400V etc.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="profile-body">Although I know nothing about cars, I get to learn of all the engineering that goes behind every part of a car and I think that is glamorous and very exciting. In addition, we work with various tools such as Altium Designer, Fusion 360, TinkerCAD, LTspice etc.</p>
